# Flower Segmentation using Image Processing Pipeline

## Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a Python program capable of segmenting various flower regions in images through an image processing pipeline. The requirements state that the program is to process one image at a time with minimal user input, and produce a binary image that marks the regions corresponding to the flower material. The solution should be as automated as posible and must be able to operate on all images without user intervention.

## Prerequisites
Before executing the program, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
- Python is installed on the system.
- Required Python libraries are installed:
  - OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python)
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy

## Setup
1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Use pip to install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-contrib-python matplotlib numpy
3. Download the Dataset: Obtain the dataset containing images to be processed and place it in the folder named 'input-images'.

## Program Execution
1. Clone or download the project repository from [GitHub link].
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the Python program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python flowerSegmentation.py
4. The program will process each image in the 'input-images' folder, segment the flower regions, and save the binary segmentation results in the 'output' folder.
5. Intermediate images generated during the processing pipeline will also be saved in the 'image-processing-pipeline' folder.
